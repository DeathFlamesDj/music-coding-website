    <p class="lead">
Hey. I'm here to talk about the amazing time i had at Xor. That trip was sooo fun. It was cool to learn about startup businesses and investing and stuff like that.

Xor was really fun. It was really interesting and I learned a lot. I'll tell about what I learned in the next paragraph. We had pizza. The pizza was tasty. I saw cool coding that confused me. They had Izzys so gives them 5 star automatically. The game that we played was fun. I found as a really interesting place. The line on the wall was very funny. My time there was humorous. I think we had a lot of fun.

I learned about startup businesses and investing. I learned that failure is the key to success. I learned how to play that game that we played at Xor. Most of these are important and are used in real life. That game wasn't that important to life. Learning how to startup a business is very important when being successful. Even if you don't plan on making a business, its good to know how to do it if you ever have the sudden urge to to that. And if you don't succeed automatically, learning from your mistakes is a good way to move forward.

 Going to Xor was very helpful and useful. To be honest, some of the stuff went over my head, but it would be something I would do again. I have to say that my favorite part was playing the game. I least favorite part was all the explanations after I saw the food arrive. I was so hungry! I want to do something like this again. I found it really fun.

This field trip was a good experience and help me understand businesses and stuff like that. I would like to go back. I learned a lot and it was fun, so it was the perfect field trip. I would recommend it for future classes.</p>
